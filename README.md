# batocera-switch
Extends Batocera and adds switch emulation

The Batocera 30 release is needed for Batocera 30, and the master branch is currently working on the Batocera 31 beta. 

Copy the folders and files in this repo into the system folder of batocera.  You will need to create a folder under the bios folder called 'switch' and put the prod.keys and title.keys under.  

Provide Yuzu and Ryujinx installs from official Yuzu/Ryujinx sites.  There are update scripts that you can run via SSH to download the files to the directory.  You need to chmod +x them before running.
